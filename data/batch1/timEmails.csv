TIM_001,Timetable Clash - KV5002 and KV4006,"Dear Dr Smith,

I've just checked my timetable for Semester 2 and I have a clash between KV5002 (Wednesday 10am-12pm) and KV4006 (Wednesday 10:30am-12:30pm). Both are listed as mandatory sessions.

Could you advise on what I should do? Is there an alternative session for either module?

Thank you,

I'm a part-time student on the KV5002 module. The timetable has all sessions scheduled during the daytime but I work full-time until 4pm. I understood there would be evening or flexible options available for part-time students.

The timetable lists a KV6003 workshop in 'CIS Lab 3' but I don't know where that is. I'm a first year in the Computing building — is it on the ground floor or the second floor?

Sorry for the basic question.

TIM_013,Extra Revision Sessions Before Exam?,"Dear Dr Smith,

With the KV4006 exam approaching, I was wondering if there will be any additional revision sessions or drop-in clinics scheduled before the exam period? A few of us in the cohort were hoping for some extra support.

If there's nothing formal, would you be open to running a Q&A session during one of the remaining weeks?

Best regards,

I'm returning from my placement year in September and need to complete KV6003 and KV5002. I've been told there may be timetable conflicts for returning placement students as some modules have moved to different semesters.

TIM_020,Reading Week Confusion,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm a bit confused about reading week. The university calendar says it's Week 7 but someone in my seminar group said KV6003 still has a session that week. Could you confirm whether there's any teaching during reading week for KV6003?

I was planning to use the week for project work but I don't want to miss anything.

Best wishes,

TIM_022,Semester 2 Start Dates and KV5002 Schedule,"Dear Dr Smith,

Could you confirm when KV5002 teaching begins in Semester 2? The module handbook says Week 1 but the university academic calendar shows an induction week before that. I'm unsure which week is actually 'Week 1' for teaching purposes.

Additionally, are the session times the same as Semester 1?

Thank you for clarifying.
