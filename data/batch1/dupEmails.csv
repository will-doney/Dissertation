Could you confirm the exact deadline for the KV6003 final project submission? The brief says May 7th but Blackboard shows May 6th. I want to make sure I don't submit late.

DUP_003,Clarification on KV6003 Submission Date,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm a bit confused about the KV6003 submission date. The assignment brief states 7th May but I've seen 6th May mentioned on Blackboard. Several of us in the cohort are unsure which is correct. Could you clarify?

Best regards,

DUP_007,KV4006 Marks - When?,"Dear Dr Smith,

We submitted the KV4006 coursework over four weeks ago and we still haven't received our grades. The module handbook states a three-week turnaround for feedback. Could you provide an update on when we can expect our results?

Thank you,

I've heard that this Friday's KV4006 lecture might be cancelled. Could you confirm whether it's going ahead? I don't want to travel in unnecessarily but I also don't want to miss it if it's on.

DUP_012,Friday Lecture - KV4006,"Hi Dr Smith,

Sorry to add to what I'm sure is a pile of emails about this — is the KV4006 lecture still on this Friday? There's been confusion in the group chat and no announcement on Blackboard.

DUP_013,Do I Need to Declare ChatGPT Use?,"Dear Dr Smith,

I used ChatGPT to help me understand some concepts for my KV6003 project and to assist with debugging. I want to be fully transparent — do I need to declare this in my report? If so, is there a specific format for referencing AI tools?

Thank you,
Olivia Hughes",assessment,KV6003,medium,FALSE

DUP_015,AI Tool Declaration - KV6003,"Dear Dr Smith,

Could you clarify the university's policy on declaring AI tool usage for the KV6003 project? I used Claude and ChatGPT during my development process for debugging assistance and understanding certain NLP concepts. I want to ensure I'm fully compliant with academic integrity policies.

Is there a recommended way to reference these tools in the report?

Kind regards,
