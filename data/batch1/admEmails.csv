ADM_001,Module Registration Issue,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm trying to register for KV6003 on the student portal but the system says the module is full. I need this module to complete my degree this year. Could you advise on whether additional places will be made available or if there's someone I should contact to resolve this?

Thank you,

ADM_003,Student ID Card Issue,"Dear Dr Smith,

Apologies for emailing you about this but I wasn't sure who else to contact. My student ID card has stopped working and I can't get into the Computing building or the labs. I've been to the student hub but they said it would take a week to replace.

Is there a temporary access solution in the meantime? I have practical sessions this week that I can't miss.

Kind regards,

ADM_004,Reference Request,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm applying for a graduate software engineering role at Accenture and they've asked for an academic reference. Would you be willing to provide a reference for me? You supervised my KV5002 project and I think you'd be best placed to comment on my technical abilities.

If you're happy to do this, I can send you the details of where to submit it.

Many thanks,

ADM_006,Interruption of Studies,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm writing to let you know that I'm considering taking an interruption of studies due to personal circumstances. I wanted to discuss this with you first as my module leader before I submit the formal application.

Could we arrange a meeting to talk through the process and what it would mean for my modules? I'm currently enrolled in KV6003 and KV5002.

Regards,

ADM_008,Letter for Visa Application,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm an international student and I need a letter confirming my enrolment and expected graduation date for my visa renewal application. The immigration office has requested this from my academic department.

Could you provide this or direct me to the right person? The deadline for my visa submission is in two weeks so this is quite time-sensitive.

Thank you very much,

ADM_010,Re: Module Selection Advice,"Dear Dr Smith,

Thank you for your advice during our meeting last week. I've decided to take KV5002 in Semester 2 as you suggested. However, the online module selection form isn't letting me add it — it says the prerequisite hasn't been met, but I passed KV4006 last year.

Could you approve an override or tell me who can?

Best regards,

ADM_012,name change on records,"Dear Dr Smith,

I have recently changed my name by deed poll and I need to update my university records. I've contacted student services but they said my module leaders also need to be informed for assessment purposes.

My previous name was Daniel Morrison and my new legal name is Dani Morrison. My student ID remains W21039284.

Could you update any relevant records on your end?

Thank you,

ADM_013,Mitigating Circumstances Panel Outcome,"Dear Dr Smith,

I submitted a mitigating circumstances claim for the KV6003 December deadline and I received an email saying it was considered by the panel. However the outcome letter is quite confusing — it says 'deferred with academic judgement' and I don't understand what this means practically. Do I resubmit? Is there a new deadline?

Could you help me understand what happens next?

Thanks,

ADM_015,Graduation Ceremony Information,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm expecting to graduate this summer and I wanted to ask about the graduation ceremony. Is there anything I need to do from the academic side to confirm my attendance? I've registered on the graduation portal but I wasn't sure if there's a separate process through the department.

Also, do you know if guests need tickets?

Kind regards,

ADM_016,Transfer Between Programmes,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm currently on the BSc Computer Science programme but I'm considering transferring to the BSc Software Engineering programme. I understand there's significant module overlap, including KV5002 and KV6003.

Could you advise on the process and whether my completed credits would transfer? I'd appreciate knowing who the best person to discuss this with formally would be.

Thank you,

ADM_018,Academic Misconduct Allegation,"Dear Dr Smith,

I have received a letter from the university stating that I am being investigated for academic misconduct in relation to my KV5002 submission. I am very worried about this as I did not intentionally plagiarise anything. I used some code from Stack Overflow but I referenced it in my comments.

Could you advise me on what to expect from this process and whether I should attend with any particular documentation?

I'm extremely anxious about the situation.

ADM_020,Joint Honours Module Confusion,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm a Joint Honours student studying Computing and Business. I've been told I need to take KV4006 but it clashes with one of my Business modules. My Business programme director said to speak to you about arranging alternative assessment or attendance arrangements.

Could we discuss possible options?

ADM_022,Changing Supervisor,"Dear Dr Smith,

This is a difficult email to write but I would like to request a change of supervisor for my KV6003 project. My current supervisor and I have different views on the direction of my project and I feel I would benefit from working with someone whose expertise is more aligned with my topic area.

I want to handle this professionally and I'm not making this decision lightly. Could you advise on the formal process for requesting this?

Kind regards,

ADM_024,Returning After Interruption,"Dear Dr Smith,

I interrupted my studies last academic year due to health reasons and I'm now returning to complete my final year. I need to re-enrol in KV6003 and KV5002 but I'm unsure whether my previous work still counts or if I need to start fresh.

Could you advise on what the re-entry process looks like and whether we could arrange an initial meeting to discuss my project?

Many thanks,
