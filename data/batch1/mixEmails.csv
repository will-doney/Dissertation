MIX_001,Few Things About KV6003,"Dear Dr Smith,

I hope you're well. I have a few things I wanted to ask about KV6003:

1. Could you confirm the deadline for the final project submission? Blackboard says May 7th but the module handbook says May 6th.
2. I'm struggling to find relevant papers for my literature review — could you recommend any journals or databases I should be searching?
3. Are we allowed to use ChatGPT to help with debugging our code, and if so, how do we reference it?

Apologies for the long email but I wanted to get everything in one message rather than sending three separate ones.

Kind regards,

MIX_003,Extension Request and Supervision Rescheduling,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm writing about two things regarding KV6003. Firstly, I've been unwell with a chest infection for the past week and I'd like to request a short extension on the interim report. I have a GP letter which I can provide.

Secondly, I won't be able to make our supervision meeting on Thursday because of a hospital appointment. Could we reschedule to the following week? I'm available Monday or Wednesday afternoon.

Thank you for understanding.

Best wishes,

MIX_005,Module Feedback and Next Year Planning,"Dear Dr Smith,

Now that KV5002 is wrapping up, I wanted to do two things. First, I wanted to say that the module has been really well taught and I've learned a lot — the practical sessions were particularly valuable.

Second, I'm choosing my modules for next year and I was wondering if you could advise on which optional modules would complement KV6003 well? I'm interested in AI and data science.

Thank you,

MIX_007,Quick Update and Questions,"Dear Dr Smith,

Just a quick email with an update and a couple of questions about KV6003.

Update: I've completed the data collection phase and have started preprocessing. The dataset is looking good — 200 emails across 6 categories.

Questions:
- Should I include the preprocessing code in the appendix or just describe it in the methodology?
- My Turnitin submission from last week still shows as 'pending' — is this normal?
- Are we allowed to use spaCy or do you prefer we stick to NLTK?

Thanks,

MIX_009,KV5002 Group Project - Multiple Concerns,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm writing about several concerns with the KV5002 group project:

1. One of our group members (I'd rather not name them in email) has not contributed and isn't responding to messages. What's the process for reporting this?
2. We're unsure whether our project topic has been approved — we submitted the proposal form two weeks ago but haven't heard back.
3. The group presentation is scheduled for Week 11 but two of us have a clash with a KV4006 lab session. Can we present at a different time?

Apologies for the lengthy email.

Best regards,

MIX_011,End of Year Admin and Project Query,"Dear Dr Smith,

As the academic year is coming to a close, I wanted to check a few things:

1. Is there a formal process for requesting my KV6003 supervisor to be my reference for graduate jobs?
2. When will final module grades be confirmed and published?
3. I noticed a discrepancy between my KV4006 grade on Blackboard (58%) and the student portal (55%) — which is correct?

Thank you for your help throughout the year.

Kind regards,

MIX_013,Placement Preparation and Module Questions,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm going on placement next year and I wanted to discuss a few things:

1. For my KV6003 project, can I base it on work I'll be doing during placement, or does it need to be independent?
2. I need a reference letter for my placement application — would you be willing to provide one?
3. Will I still have access to Blackboard and university resources while on placement?

I appreciate your time.

Thank you,

MIX_014,kv4006 and kv5002 problems,"hi dr smith

thx

MIX_015,Returning Student - Multiple Queries,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm returning to university after a year out on interruption. I have several questions:

1. Do I need to re-register for KV6003 formally or does my previous enrolment carry over?
2. My previous supervisor has left the university — who will be assigned as my new supervisor?
3. I submitted a partial draft before I left. Is this still on record or do I need to start again?
4. Are the module learning outcomes the same as last year or has the curriculum changed?

I'd appreciate a meeting to discuss the transition back.

Thank you,
David Kim",admin|assessment|resources,KV6003,high,TRUE
MIX_016,Dissertation and Career Advice,"Dear Dr Smith,

I hope this isn't overstepping but I'd value your advice on two things. My KV6003 project is on NLP-based email classification and I'm really enjoying it. I wanted to ask:

1. Do you think the project has potential to be extended into a publishable paper? If so, what would I need to add?
2. I'm considering a career in NLP/AI research. Based on my work so far, do you think a masters or PhD would be a good next step?

No pressure to answer the career question if you'd rather not — I just respect your opinion.

Best wishes,

MIX_017,complaint and extension request,"hi dr smith

im going to be blunt. the kv5002 assignment brief is really unclear and ive wasted days trying to figure out what section B is actually asking for. ive asked 3 other students and none of us agree on what its meant to be. i think this is unfair and the brief should be rewritten or clarified.

because of the confusion ive lost time and now i need an extension. i know thats not a proper extenuating circumstance but its the universitys fault not mine

sorry if this comes across as rude im just frustrated

MIX_018,International Student - Various Concerns,"Dear Dr Smith,

As an international student I have a few concerns I'd appreciate your help with:

1. The KV4006 exam is scheduled during Ramadan. Will there be any accommodations for fasting students, such as adjusted timing or breaks?
2. I'm having difficulty understanding some of the British-specific references in the KV5002 case studies. Are there alternative materials available?
3. My visa requires me to maintain 80% attendance. I missed some sessions due to illness — will my EC claim cover the attendance gap?

Thank you for your understanding.

MIX_019,summer resit and next year stuff,"hi dr smith

so i failed kv4006 which is annoying but it is what it is. couple of questions:

1. when is the resit and is it an exam or coursework
2. if i pass the resit do i still get capped at 40%
3. can i still take kv5002 next semester while doing the resit or is kv4006 a prerequisite
4. also unrelated but the kv5002 reading list link is broken

MIX_020,Thank You and Final Questions,"Dear Dr Smith,

As we approach the end of the year, I wanted to thank you for your support throughout KV6003. Your feedback on my drafts has been invaluable and the project has genuinely been the highlight of my degree.

A few final questions:
1. Is there a specific time on May 7th the submission needs to be in, or is it midnight?
2. Do you have any advice for the viva? I'm quite nervous about presenting.
3. Would you be open to staying in touch after graduation? I'd like to keep you updated on where I end up.

With sincere thanks,
Fatima Al-Rashid",assessment|feedback|admin,KV6003,low,TRUE
