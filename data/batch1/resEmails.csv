RES_001,Lecture Slides - Week 6 KV5002,"Dear Dr Smith,

I noticed that the lecture slides for Week 6 of KV5002 haven't been uploaded to Blackboard yet. Could you let me know when they'll be available? I'd like to review them before next week's session.

RES_003,Recommended Reading for Literature Review,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm working on the literature review for my KV6003 project and I'm struggling to find enough quality sources on email classification using NLP. Could you recommend any key papers or textbooks I should be looking at?

I've already found a few through the library but I feel like I'm missing some foundational work.

Kind regards,

RES_005,Software Installation Help - Python,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm trying to install Python and Jupyter Notebook on my personal laptop for KV6003 but I'm running into errors. I followed the instructions on Blackboard but the Anaconda installer keeps failing. Are there alternative installation instructions or could you point me to a guide?

Also, is there a specific version of Python we need to be using for the module?

I'm trying to access the GitHub Classroom repository for KV5002 but the invite link from Blackboard gives me a 404 error. I've tried on both Chrome and Firefox. My GitHub username is dkim_dev22.

Could you resend the invite or check if there's an issue with the link?

RES_009,Database Software for KV4006,"Dear Dr Smith,

In the last lecture you mentioned we'd need MySQL Workbench for the practical sessions. Is this available on the university lab computers or do we need to install it ourselves? If we need to install it, is there a student licence or should we use the community edition?

Thank you,

RES_010,CANT FIND ANYTHING ON BLACKBOARD,"HI DR SMITH

I CANT FIND ANY OF THE RESOURCES FOR KV6003 ON BLACKBOARD. THE MODULE PAGE JUST HAS THE ASSIGNMENT BRIEF AND NOTHING ELSE. WHERE ARE THE LECTURE SLIDES AND THE READING LIST AND THE PROJECT GUIDELINES??

AM I LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE??

RES_011,Additional Resources for Machine Learning Topic,"Dear Dr Smith,

I've been going through the KV5002 content on machine learning algorithms and I'm finding the lecture material quite high-level. Are there any additional resources you'd recommend — YouTube channels, online courses, or supplementary textbooks — that might help me understand the concepts in more depth?

I learn better with worked examples if that helps narrow it down.

Best wishes,

RES_013,Access to University Software Remotely,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm a commuter student and I do most of my work from home. Is there a way to access the university's software remotely — specifically the tools we use for KV4006 like MySQL and the Oracle database? I heard there's a virtual desktop but I'm not sure how to set it up.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Thanks,

RES_015,KV6003 Project Template,"Dear Dr Smith,

Is there a report template we should be using for the KV6003 project submission? I want to make sure I'm following the correct formatting and structure. If there isn't a template, could you advise on the expected format — font size, line spacing, heading structure etc.?

Thank you,

RES_017,Lecture Recording Quality Issue,"Dear Dr Smith,

I've been watching the KV4006 Panopto recordings and the audio quality on the last three recordings has been very poor — there's a constant buzzing sound and your voice cuts out frequently. It's quite difficult to follow.

Is there anything that can be done to fix this? Could you perhaps upload the slides with audio notes as an alternative?

Thanks,

Are you planning to release the solutions for the KV4006 tutorial worksheets? We've been working through them in study groups but we'd like to check our answers. Even if it's just for the first few weeks that would be helpful.

RES_024,Library Access for External Journals,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm trying to access some IEEE and ACM papers for my KV6003 literature review but the library portal keeps asking me to pay. I thought we had institutional access to these databases? Am I doing something wrong or do I need to request access separately?
