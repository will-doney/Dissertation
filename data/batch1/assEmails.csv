I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to enquire about the deadline for Assignment 2 in KV6003. I have checked Blackboard but I can only see the brief and not a confirmed submission date. Could you please clarify when this is due?

Thank you for your time.

ASS_003,KV5002 Coursework Submission Query,"Dear Lecturer,

I wanted to check — do we submit the KV5002 coursework through Turnitin on Blackboard or is there a separate submission link? I remember you mentioned something in the lecture but I wasn't sure.

Also what is the file format? Can I submit a .zip or does it need to be a PDF?

Thanks,

ASS_004,URGENT - Extension Needed for Assignment,"Hi,

I'm really struggling with the KV6003 assignment and I don't think I'll be able to submit on time. I've been working on it but I've had issues with my laptop breaking and I lost some of my work. Is there any way I can get an extension? Even a couple of days would help.

Sorry for the late notice.

Thanks,

ASS_006,Resit Information KV4006,"Dear Dr Smith,

I unfortunately failed the KV4006 databases module last semester. Could you provide information on the resit process? Specifically:

1. When is the resit submission deadline?
2. Is it the same assignment brief or a new one?
3. Do I need to re-register for the module?

I would appreciate any guidance you can offer.

ASS_008,KV5002 Assignment Feedback Request and Deadline Query,"Good afternoon,

I was wondering whether feedback for Assignment 1 in KV5002 has been released yet? I submitted three weeks ago and haven't received anything on Turnitin.

Additionally, I wanted to confirm the deadline for Assignment 2 — is it still Week 12 Friday at 2pm?

Many thanks,

ASS_009,Plagiarism concern,"Dear Dr Smith,

I have a concern about my submission for KV6003. After submitting, my Turnitin similarity score came back at 34% and I'm worried this will be flagged as plagiarism. Most of the matches seem to be from the reference list and some common phrases. Should I be concerned? Is there someone I can speak to about this?

I'm quite anxious about it.

ASS_012,Assignment Brief Clarification KV5002,"Dear Dr Smith,

Apologies for the email, I know you probably get asked this a lot. I'm looking at the KV5002 assignment brief and I'm unsure about the requirement for 'critical evaluation of your chosen methodology.' Does this mean I need to compare it against alternative methodologies, or just discuss the strengths and weaknesses of my chosen approach?

Any clarification would be really helpful.

Best wishes,

ASS_014,Group Project Concerns,"Dear Dr Smith,

I'm writing about the group project for KV5002. Unfortunately, one of our group members has not contributed anything and is not responding to our messages. We've tried contacting them through WhatsApp and email but they haven't replied in two weeks.

I don't want to get a lower mark because of this situation. What should we do? Is there a process for reporting non-contributing members?

Thank you,

Please find attached my interim report for KV6003. I wanted to submit it early to get your thoughts before the final deadline. I'm particularly unsure about my literature review section and whether I've covered enough ground.

ASS_018,Re: KV4006 Coursework - Additional Question,"Hi Dr Smith,

Thanks for your response earlier about the database schema requirements. I have one more question — do we need to include test data in our submission or just the empty schema with the SQL scripts?

Also, is there a specific naming convention you want us to follow for the tables?

ASS_020,Academic Integrity Query,"Dear Dr Smith,

I have a question about academic integrity for the KV6003 project. I used ChatGPT to help me understand some concepts and to help debug some of my Python code. I want to be transparent about this — do I need to declare this usage? If so, how should I reference it in my report?

I want to make sure I'm doing everything correctly.

ASS_027,Assignment 2 - Can I Use My Own Dataset?,"Dear Dr Smith,

For Assignment 2 in KV5002, the brief mentions using the provided dataset. However, I have access to a more relevant dataset from my part-time job that I think would make for a more interesting analysis. Would it be acceptable to use this instead, or do we strictly need to use the one provided?

I can provide details of the dataset if needed.

ASS_029,Formal Request for Assessment Feedback - KV6003,"Dear Dr Smith,

I am writing to formally request detailed feedback on my KV6003 Computing Project interim submission, which was returned to me on 15th March with a grade of 52%. While I appreciate the grade, the written feedback was quite brief and I am struggling to understand specifically where I lost marks.

I would be grateful if you could provide more detailed commentary on:
- The literature review section
- My methodology justification
- The system design diagrams

I believe this will be essential for improving my final submission. I am happy to arrange a meeting at your convenience to discuss this further.

Yours sincerely,
